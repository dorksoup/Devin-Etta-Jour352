For ED Data Express, the Department has aggregated the data to the LEA and SEA level for user convenience. Aggregated data are impacted by quality issues in the source data, which, in this case, are the school level. Also, student counts may be duplicative. Students are reported in each school in which they are enrolled and absent 10% or more school days during the school year. As a result, students who are defined and reported as chronically absent at more than one school in a given school year will be counted more than once when aggregated up to the LEA, SEA, and national levels.","The state notes in all sections of ED Data Express reflect the views of the state only and do no necessarily reflect compliance with requirements or consistency with reporting instructions."
